Next Steps:

- Rather than relying on the RobustScaler to address all the outliers, see if removing them via a standard deviation-based threshold will improve model accuracy.
- Explore alternatives to the decisions made during preprocessing, to see how if model accuracy can be improved by changing my assumptions.
- For highly correlated features, drop one of them. For example, Tax Liens and Bankruptcies.
